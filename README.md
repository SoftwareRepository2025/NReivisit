# Research Dataset for Developing Data-Driven Developer-Centric Software Complexity Metrics

## Open Science Commitment

This repository follows Open Science principles, including providing full access to data, preprocessing scripts, and analysis results to ensure reproducibility and transparency. The datasets are publicly available under the [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license via Zenodo. All data, including EEG and eye-tracking data, code regions, and associated preprocessing scripts, are available for reuse and repurposing.

## Overview

This repository contains datasets and preprocessing steps used in our research on analyzing EEG and eye tracking data for code comprehension tasks. We conducted experiments with 35 participants, each performing 4 code tasks chosen randomly in 4 runs. The datasets are structured for reproducibility and further analysis.

## Datasets

We have three important datasets in this experiment:

### EEG Data

#### Raw Data:
- 35 participants
- 20 `.cnt` files (named `si_j`, where `i=1:20` for participants and `j=1:4` for runs)

#### Preprocessing:
Preprocessing was performed using **EEGLAB**, an interactive MATLAB toolbox. The following steps were applied:
- **EEG channel location setup**
- **Filtering**: 
  - High-pass filter at 1 Hz
  - Low-pass filter at 40 Hz
- **Channels spatial interpolation**:
  - Remove flat or noisy channels from the data.
  - Replace them with interpolated signals derived from the remaining channels using the Spherical spline interpolation algorithm.
- **Referencing**: Average reference
- **ICA (Independent Component Analysis)**: Extended Infomax using `runica`
- **Artifact removal**: Manually operated

#### Final Structure:
The processed EEG data is stored in `eeg_data.mat` and contains 20 structs, one for each participant. Each struct is named `si_tj` (where `i=1:20` for participants, `j=1:4` for tasks). The struct contains the following fields:
- `eeg_data_struct.(field_name).feature`: Two features extracted from the data
- `eeg_data_struct.(field_name).time`: Corresponding time data

### Eye Tracking Data

#### Raw Data:
- 35 participants
- 35 `.mat` files

#### Preprocessing:
- Artifact Removal
- Missing Data Handling
- Filtering
- Coordinate Mapping
- Resampling

#### Final Structure:
The processed eye tracking data is stored in `eye_data.mat`, which contains 35 structs for 35 participants. Each struct is named `si_tj` (where `i=1:35` for participants, `j=1:4` for tasks). The struct contains the following fields:
- `eye_data.code_time`: Time when participants read the code task
- `eye_data.gaze_x`: Horizontal coordinates of eye gaze position
- `eye_data.gaze_y`: Vertical coordinates of eye gaze position

### Code Regions

The regions of interest for the code tasks are defined in the file `study0_1_tasks_regions.xlsx`.
